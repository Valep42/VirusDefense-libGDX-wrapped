Virus Defense libGDX wrapped
==========================
This is the old discontinued Version of the game. For the newest Version go [here](https://github.com/Valep42/VirusDefense-libGDX-port).


This is more or Less [Virus Defense](https://github.com/Valep42/VirusDefense) of July 19, 2014 (Commit [48058a3](https://github.com/Valep42/VirusDefense/commit/48058a3b5135180a4b38c27351285122ca1359a3)), wrapped with libGDX. To port the newest Version of Virus Defense to this libGDX Version requires basically no code change. The src files go into core/src and the data into android/assets/data. When creating a runnable jar, the path of files that will be modified must be changed to `./data/files`, exactly as in the original Virus Defense.

A runnable jar is available at [Releases](https://github.com/Valep42/VirusDefense-libGDX-wrapped/releases).

The reason that this is a fork of [this Demo](https://github.com/badlogic/theplanethatcouldntflygood) is, that I used that to get the basic libGDX file structure.
